# Hero Code First Challenge

Welcome to Hero Code's first Tech Challenge. The objective of this challenge is to prepare for a technical challenge that is quite common in job interviews, not only that, but also to improve programming skills with the test that was prepared.

The best of all is that whoever wins the competition will also receive a pix worth R$100.00 ü§ë

## üî® Project features

This challenge aims to assess front-end development skills, the ability to follow a design in Figma and creativity in implementation Remembering that this challenge is a test to simulate a technical job interview test, so it is crucial to approach the challenge in the same way you would face a real job interview situation.

Here are the adapted features:

Technology: You are free to choose the technology you prefer (React, Angular, Vue.js, etc.) to implement the solution.
Deadline: Submit your solution by 12/10/2023 to participate in the competition.
Assessment: The code will be evaluated based on fidelity to the design, structure and organization of the code, good development practices, responsiveness and performance.
Prize: The developer who presents the best solution, according to the criteria above, will receive a prize of R$100.00.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Techniques and technologies used

Check out this list of everything we will use in this app:

- `Vite`
- `TypeScript`
- `Emotion`
- `Recoil`
- `Vercel Deployment`
- `GitHub`

## üõ†Ô∏è Open and run the project

To open and run the project, run `npm i` to install the dependencies and `npm run develop` to start the project.

Then go to <a href="http://localhost:5173/">http://localhost:5173/</a> in your browser.

## üìö More tutorial information

Hero Code, first challenge is a Trello-style application for creating tasks and moving them according to their status, developed based on the [Figma] design (https://www.figma.com/file/FN5DlLxrnGycHs4E49ebDi/Challenge-tech-01? type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=J5UIq1KW88YiL0zk-1) from [Hero Code](https://www.youtube.com/@herocodebr).
The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis technical test is to improve hardskills in the frontend, and as a bonus, receive a code evaluation for participating in the competition. I took the opportunity to take a course from [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/curso-online-react-gerenciando-estado-recoil) on [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) and implement this state manager in the application. It is an option for us to solve drilling props alternatively like react context/redux/zustand. It was very quick and simple to use, I liked what I tried.
